# AI Test Case Generator

## Overview
AI Test Case Generator is an intelligent tool designed to automatically generate test cases for software applications. Using GPT-powered natural language processing, this tool takes in feature descriptions or user inputs and generates a variety of test cases, helping QA engineers automate and streamline their testing efforts. The generated test cases include various types such as functional, GUI, negative, and boundary tests.

## Features
- **Automated Test Case Generation**: Automatically generates test cases based on input functionality.
- **Predefined and Custom Scenarios**: Users can input specific functionalities, and the AI will generate test cases covering multiple scenarios.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Leverages OpenAIâ€™s GPT models to understand and interpret feature requirements written in natural language.
- **Exportable Test Cases**: Test cases are generated in a structured format, which can be exported for use in test automation suites.
- **Support for Multiple Test Types**: Functional, GUI, boundary, and negative test cases are supported.
  
## Pre-Conditions
1. **API Key for OpenAI**: 
   - To use the GPT-powered test case generation, you need an API key from OpenAI. You can obtain the API key from [OpenAI's API page](https://platform.openai.com/signup).
   - Once you have the API key, add it as an environment variable:
     
      API_KEY = "api-key by OpenAI"
     

## Technologies Involved
- **Python**: The core language used to build the AI Test Case Generator.
- **OpenAI GPT API**: Provides natural language processing capabilities to interpret and generate test cases based on user inputs.
- **Streamlit**: A framework used for building the web interface, allowing users to interact with the test case generator in a user-friendly manner.
- **Pandas**: Utilized for handling data structures and exporting test cases in various formats (CSV, Excel, etc.).
- **Git**: Version control for managing the project codebase.


## Example
If the input functionality is "Login" the AI Test Case Generator will create test cases like:

Test Case ID	Steps	Expected Results	Type of Test
TC01	Enter valid username and password and click 'Login'	User is successfully logged in	Functional
TC02	Enter invalid username and password and click 'Login'	Error message is displayed	Negative
TC03	Leave username and password fields empty and click 'Login'	Error message prompts user to enter credentials	GUI
